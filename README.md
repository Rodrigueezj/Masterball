# Introduction
This nice puzzle is consists of a ball which is sliced up like an orange into 8 segments, and the whole is also divided horizontally into 4 layers (two polar caps and two middle bands). In other words, it is like a globe with 8 lines of longitude and 3 lines of latitude.

There are two types of move: A half turn of half the ball along any of the lines of longitude, called a slice move, or a 1/8 turn of one of the 4 layers.

On the standard puzzle, the Rainbow Master (sometimes known as the 'geomaster'), each of the 8 segments has a different colour. Other designs have pictures on them. The Rainbow version is easier than a picture version because the pieces occur in identical pairs in opposite layers.

                                                                             taken from=https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/master.htm
